I am highly regarded for my dedication and loyalty to my employer, their workers, customers and suppliers and, above all, the owners and executives to whom I provide support. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAt the Canadian Cancer Society, PEI Division, as Executive Assistant, I provided ongoing support to the Executive Director and Board of Directors. A brief overview of my tasks included complex calendar scheduling, communication and planning of external meetings, travel arrangements and expense claims, detailed Board meeting preparation and recording of minutes and action items.  In addition to providing full support to the Executive Office, I was an active and valued member of the Senior Management Team. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs Office Manager, I ensured the smooth operation of the Society\u2019s office space, including telephones, office supplies, furniture and lease agreements.  In all aspects of managing the office, I attempted to refine tasks so they were completed more efficiently and negotiated pricing to reduce associated costs to accommodate budget restrictions.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn my previous position at Empire Marketing, while providing ongoing assistance to three executives, I successfully managed and supervised a staff of three in the Administration Department and smoothly and efficiently managed an office of over eighty staff members. In addition, I provided daily assistance to the Human Resources and Security Consultants where confidentiality and discretion were of utmost importance.  As a volunteer member of the Charity and Social Club Committees, I also enjoyed bringing people together for fun and fulfilling events.   <br \/>\n<br \/>\nI have been commended for my exceptional problem solving, organizational and time management skills, attention to detail, team spirit, and ability to multi task. I have been privy to highly confidential information and have proven to be a valuable and trusted member of the senior level team. An ability to develop strong and lasting business relationships is a solid reflection of my strong interpersonal and communication skills. Recognized as flexible and eager to learn, my past participation in new projects and new programs enabled me to become deeply involved with my employer\u2019s goals and commitments.<br \/>\n","experience":[{"title":"Executive Assistant\/Office Manager","location":"Charlottetown, PE","company":"Canadian Cancer Society, PEI Division","start_month":"Mar","start_year":"2009","end_year":"2013","end_month":"Nov","description":"EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT <br \/>\nAssist the Executive Director with complex calendar scheduling, correspondence, daily planning, organizing tasks; Support Senior Management team; book travel arrangements; process expense claims; assist Board of Directors with various tasks, schedule committee meetings; plan and organize Board meetings, Annual General Meeting, teleconferences; prepare background material for Board meetings; participate in meetings and record minutes and action items; liaise with Board members,  all levels of staff, government offices, volunteers, clients and business colleagues; set up and maintain paper and electronic filing systems.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOFFICE MANAGER <br \/>\nMonitor and approve purchases of office supplies to ensure expenses are kept within budget restrictions; negotiate leases for office equipment; research market value for office space and negotiate terms for lease.<br \/>\nCoordinate office move for a staff of ten; organize and eliminate excess office furniture; coordinate move requirements for system server, data, telephone, electric lines and electronic security system. <br \/>\n<br \/>\n","id":"2652"},{"title":"Data Research Clerk","location":"Charlottetown, PE","company":"Veterans Affairs Canada","start_month":"Oct","start_year":"2008","end_year":"2009","end_month":"Feb","description":"DATA RESEARCH - STATISTICS, FINANCE DEPARTMENT -  3-MONTH CASUAL POSITION <br \/>\nResearch electronic (CSDN) and paper files to determine effective dates for disability pensions.
